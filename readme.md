Jasmine setup


When we initialize jasmine in our project, jasmine spins up a spec directory with nothing in it, and a support directory with a jasmine.json file. The spec directory is where you should put all of your test files. The support directory is where jasmine tells the testing framework how to run the tests (you don't have to make any changes there).
